# GoKwikCache

## EXECUTION

Please run "npm run start" command.

## DESCRIPTION

A LRU Cache that is extensible enough to support other eviction policies. The primary goal of this solution is to ensure SOLID principles are followed.

## EXPLANATION

- Cache Storage: Entity to hold data of cache with a designated capacity. eg: SetStorage, MapStorage etc.

- Structures: Folder for implementing primay datastructures. eg: LinkedList,Heap etc.

- Eviction Strategies: Strategy to implement eviction policies on caches. eg: LRU, FIFO, MRU etc.

- Cache: Entity with a storage and an eviction policy to refer items in O(1) time complexity. eg: LRU Cache

Other pointers:

- All the classes adhere to SOLID principles.
- Cache Factory follows Factory Pattern to create different flavours of Caches with different storages and different eviction strategies.
- Structures: DoublyLinkedList inorder to implement O(1) reordering. They do not have a maximum size.

## THINGS TO IMPROVE

Exception handling with various error types could be added (Factory method to create different error message based on error codes)
Unit Testing (A comprehensive test suite for testing various use cases)
Other functionalities of classes such as LinkedLists' removeFromTail is yet to be implemented.
